## General Experiences

In a very broad and brief way, my experience gained throughout the years are summed up in a few categories to give you a quick overall view to understand my abilities. All of the corresponding projects are linked to the related directory to showcase the functionality in the particular knowledge domain presented in this read-me file.


## üìÇ Project Highlights

TODO


### Data Structures

During all of my invested time in online sites such as *AlgoExpert* and *Hackerrank*, I cultivated a theoretical and practical familiarity with data structures in [Problem Solving](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/problem-solving?ref_type=heads). Later on I attended [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1/5.%20Data%20Structures%20&%20Algorithms?ref_type=heads) and became more knowledgeable in the field. Eventually, I identified the opportunity of using a priority que combined with a max heap in [Distributed Systems, Clinic Service]() to reduce the time complexity of the operations in the microservice architecture. Keeping all of this in mind, I made the following self-assessment of my proficiencies:

### Programming Languages

I made the following evalaution of my programming language skills due to my track record demonstrated below:

### Amazon Web Services

In the summer of 2024 I integrated AWS in some of my projects, and I ended up working with the following services:

- **Bedrock:**
    - [AWS Bedrock Generative AI](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/2.%20spare-time/11.%20AWS%20Bedrock%20Generative%20AI?ref_type=heads)

### Other Programming Concepts Covered

These general software engineering concepts provide a comprehensive foundation for building, maintaining, and delivering high-quality software. They encompass a range of practices from planning, designing, and coding to testing, deploying, and maintaining applications effectively. Mastering these concepts is essential for producing reliable, scalable, and user-friendly software solutions


#### Object Oriented Programming

OOP is a paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. Classes define the blueprint for creating objects, specifying attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors). Key principles of OOP include:
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods together to restrict direct access to some of an object's components.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details to focus on simpler high-level interactions.
- **Inheritance:** Allowing new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Enabling functions or methods to work in different ways based on input or context.

SOLID Principles help in designing systems that are easy to understand, flexible, and maintainable:
- **Single Responsibility:** Each class should have one responsibility.
- **Open-Closed:** Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution:** Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.
- **Interface Segregation:** Many small, specific interfaces are better than a single general-purpose one.
- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules directly.

#### Software Testing and Quality Assurance

Testing is vital for verifying that software meets requirements and performs as expected. It includes:

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or functions:

#### Software Development Lifecycles

A Software Development Life Cycle is the process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software. It includes stages such as:

- **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** *Understanding what the user needs*

  - [Requirements & User Experience](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1/4.%20Requirements%20&%20User%20Experience?ref_type=heads)

  - [Software Development Methodologies](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-2/4.%20Software%20Development%20Methodologies?ref_type=heads)


- **Design:** *Architecting and structuring the software solution*

  - [Data Management](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1/6.%20Data%20Management?ref_type=heads)
  - [Software Analysis & Construction](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1/8.%20Software%20Analysis%20Construction?ref_type=heads)

- **Implementation:** *Writing and developing the code*

  - [Team Programming & Management](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1/3.%20Team%20Programming%20&%20Management?ref_type=heads)
